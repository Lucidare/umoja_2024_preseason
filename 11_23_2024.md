What was covered:
##### Simple terminal/bash commands and understanding terminal - `.`, `..`, `ls`, `cd`, `man`, `clear`, `^C`

`.`     means current working directory (basically the folder you're in)
`..`	parent directory
`ls`	list directory (lists all directories at location, defaulted to .)
`cd`	change directory (usually to go into a separate folder/previous folder) i.e. `cd ..`
`man`   opens the manual of a specific command i.e. `man ls` provides info on ls (can also simply search it up online)
`^C`    Intrupt signal send by pressing `CTRL + C` in the termianl (can be used to exit programs like the man command above)
`clear` clears the terminal

##### Git terms/commands - `remote`, `local`, `branch`, `git init`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git fetch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`, `Merge Conflicts`, `PR`

`remote` - Online version of the repo (can also be called origin)
`local` - local version of the repo (on your machine)
`branch` - different version of the repo (can have multiple branches)
Usually repos have a `master` branch which contains finalized versions (sometimes called `main`). Ideally we don't commit directly onto this branch, and only do so through pull requests (`PR`) with someone else reviewing

`git init` - Initializes git on the current working directory which allows it to start tracking commits
Only required when making a new repo
    
`git clone` - Pulls the repo from the provided remote repo into the current working directory
i.e. `git clone https://github.com/Lucidare/umoja-git.git`

`git add` - Adds the changes you want to be a part of the commit to "staging" which basically means it's ready to be commited
i.e. `git add .` Adds all files in current working directory
i.e. `git add example.txt` Adds ONLY example.txt
To remove something that is already added you can use this command `git restore --staged`
i.e. `git remove --staged example.txt` Removes example.txt from staging
    
`git commit` - Commits all changes that are staged (basically takes everything you've added and packages it together)
i.e. `git commit -m "Added example.txt"` Takes all changes and commits it with the provided message
Commit message shouuld briefly explain the changes you've made so it's easier to find/understand in the future
    
`git push` - Pushes all changes in local repo branch to the remote repo branch
If local repo isn't hooked up to a remote one yet, or local branch doesn't exist on remote branch, you'll need to link it with the following `git push --set-upstream origin branchName`.
Ideally we keep the local branch name the same as the remote branch name to keep things from becoming confusing.
We also have to keep our local repo up to date with the remote repo before you can push, so have to pull changes if not up to date.
Note: You can only push to repo's you have access to (getting added as collaborator)
    
`git pull` - Pulls all changes from remote repo branch to local repo branch
This can potentially cause merge conflicts if the remote repo has changes to the same lines/files in you current local repo
    
`git fetch` - Updates your local repo with all updates (such as new branches)
    
`git checkout` - Switches from current branch to other branch
i.e. `git checkout brian` switches from current branch to branch `brian`
If branch does not exist, you can create a new one with the following command
i.e. `git checkout -B brian` creates new branch called `brian` and switches to that branch
note: when making a new branch, it is based off of the currrent branch
    
`git merge` - Merges commits from one branch to current branch
i.e. `git merge brian` Updates current branch with commits from branch `brian`
This can potentially cause merge conflicts if the remote repo has changes to the same lines/files in you current local repo
    
`Merge Conflicts` - Conflicts that occur when multiple commits have changes to the same lines
usually represented as

    <<<<<< HEAD
    changes from current branch
    =======
    changes from other branch on same line
    >>>>>>> new_branch_to_merge_later
To fix, simply remove all extra lines, save the lines you want (can be lines from both commits) and make a new commit for the merge
VSCode makes this easy and lets this be done with a click of the button
i.e. if I want to only keep the one line

    changes from current branch
    
`PR` - Pull Request, can be opened on Github to merge from one branch to another branch while allowing for reviews, comments, approvals, or rejecting changes.
Note: You can still make a PR to a repo that someone else owns, however you would need to fork the repo (basically a copy of their repo but under your account). You can then make changes with your repo and make a PR from your repo to theirs.

##### FRC Robot Code

Files located under `src/main/java/frc/robot/`
Most logic is in the file `robot.java`

Main functions are `robotInit()`, `robotPeriodic()`, `autonomousInit()`, `autonomousPeriodic()`, `teleopInit()`, `teleopPeriodic()`

`robotInit()` gets called once when the robot starts up
`robotPeriodic()` gets called every 20ms while the robot is on
`autonomousInit()` gets called once at the start of autonomous mode (first 15 seconds of the game)
`autonomousPeriodic()` gets called every 20ms for the duration of autonomous mode
`teleopInit()` gets called once at the start of the telop mode (during the remain 2:15 seconds of the game)
`teleopPeriodic()` gets called every 20ms for the druation of teleop mode

  @Override

    // negative exists here because when you move the joystick forward, it goes the value goes the -1
